# Learn Web3 Sophomore Monorepo

Lots of people wondering how to keep their github "clean", and this is a possible solution.

To deploy in vercel, you need to:
1. Create a new project
2. Choose this repo
3. Set a sensible project name
4. Set framework preset to "Next.js"
5. Set the "root directory" to the root of the next.js project being deployed (e.g. nft-collection/frontend)
6. Deploy!
